SYNOPSIS                                                              
       date [OPTION]... [+FORMAT]                                      
       date [-u|--utc|--universal] [MMDDhhmm[[CC]YY][.ss]]
       
In this SYNOPSIS there are two syntaxes for the date command. 
The first one is used to display the date on the system while the second is used to set the date.

The ellipsis ... following [OPTION] indicates that one or more of the items before it may be used.

Additionally, the [-u|--utc|--universal] notation means that either the -u option or the --utc option or the --universal option may be used. Typically this means that all three options really do the same thing, 
but sometimes the use of the | character is used to indicate that the options can't be used in combination, like a logical â€œor".
