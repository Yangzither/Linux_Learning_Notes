SYNOPSIS                                                              
       date [OPTION]... [+FORMAT]                                      
       date [-u|--utc|--universal] [MMDDhhmm[[CC]YY][.ss]]
       
In this SYNOPSIS there are two syntaxes for the date command. 
The first one is used to display the date on the system while the second is used to set the date.

The ellipsis ... following [OPTION] indicates that one or more of the items before it may be used.

Additionally, the [-u|--utc|--universal] notation means that either the -u option or the --utc option or the --universal option may be used. Typically this means that all three options really do the same thing, 
but sometimes the use of the | character is used to indicate that the options can't be used in combination, like a logical â€œor".

man man

/foo
it will search from the current position downwards till the end of documents.
type n key for next one, and type shift +n for last one. 

//man passwd >> Search by name 
man -f passwd  It displays man pages that match, or partially match, a specific name and provide the section number and a brief description of each man page
man 1 passwd
man 5 passwd
* command whatis does the same thing

//man -k passwd >> searches both name and descriptions of the man pages
* apropos does the same thing

==========
Whereis >> for searching commands and main pages 
This command searches for commands, source files and man pages in specific locations where these files are typically stored:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ whereis ls 
ls: /bin/ls /usr/share/man/man1p/ls.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz

The above shows ls command is associatd with two man pages. Man pages are typically compressed with program called gzip and ends in .gz
As such for the above example, /bin/ls is command, the other two in .gz are man pages. 

This is because the ls command can be used with the options/features that are described by either man page
