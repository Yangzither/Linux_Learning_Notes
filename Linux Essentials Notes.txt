****** How to Remotly login Centos VM************
From VM -> System -> Network -> NAT -> Port Forwarding
Set Host IP as: 127.0.0.1 which is your local host ip address
Set Host Port as: 2222
Set Guest IP as 10.0.2.15, this is the ip address of your VM
Set Guest IP as 22

From your local host:
ssh -p 2222 root@127.0.0.1
From here your are logged into VM Centos

Notes: here 2222 is the port Number on your local Host
127.0.0.1 is your loop back ip address of your local machine

root is the user name of your select username from VM

File Globbing
*
? ---> Single Character
! ---> not
[a-z] [0-9] [!0-8]
.[!.]*  --->not to display any files starts with 2 dots at the front
ls -d (notes: d option is not to show any directory contents)

The shell expands the wildcard characters and feed it into commands.

Remember, the wildcard character matches every filename character in any position.

It's very important that there is one exception to this rule: it does not match
filenames starting with a dot, which are called hidden files in Linux.

The question mark does the same, but only in a single position;
it also doesn't match filenames with the leading dot.

The brackets match specific characters in a single position defined between the brackets.
When having consecutive permitted characters, you can also use the dash symbol.
To match everything except a set of characters at a specific position, use the exclamation mark in brackets.

****************************************************
Quoting commands
The purpose is to disable shell expansions
'' Using single quotes is the preferred way when working with shell
" "Double quotes is the same but with exception of some environment variables such as $PATH
\ Back slash is the same as single quotes but only affect and only affect the next single character

****************************************************
Getting help
1. man man (Manual)

man command
man -k copy (notes: search everything that has something to do with copy)
man 8 commands (notes: 8 is the section name)

2. command --help (command help)

3. info command (information page)

Extra information under,
/usr/share/doc

Command format:
Commands [OPTION]...[FILE]...
Notes: anything within []is optional, '...' means option can be repeated
anything without [] is mandantory

On man page, / back slash can be used for search text
H for text browsing Commands
n for next matching item
N for previous matching item

****************************************************
Working with Linux shell
man bash ---> for keyboard shortcuts
history
!163 Enter ---> re-execute the 163th command from history
!! ---> run the last command from history
Ctl - C terminate program
Ctl - Z Suspend a program
bg ---> bring program to background
fg ---> bring program to foreground

****************************************************
Standard Streams
Standard input 0
Standard output 1
Stander error 2

eg.
ls /var/lib/systemd/ 1> /temp/stdout-output.txt 2>/temp/stderr-output.text
notes: 1 is ouput to standard output files
       2 is output to standeard error filenames

You can also redirect stdinput to stderr by: 1>&2

Rediret to /dev/Null is to avoid generates any output
eg ls /dev/Null

To Archive and Zip a file:
tar -cv /home/Test | gzip > /home/my_tar_zip_file.tar.zip

To append content rather then replace the original content, use:
echo "Hello World" >> /temp/myText.txt

Centos regular experession manual ??????????
Regular expression are used to search a pattern in a text or string

Regular expressions, also referred to as regex, are a collection of normal and special characters that are used to find simple or complex patterns,
respectively, in files. These characters are characters that are used to perform a particular matching function in a search.

Always put regular expression in a ////single quote//// to avoid mesh up with file gobbling.

A few examples
grep '\*' /etc/services  notes: \ escaping to search for a special character like "*"
grep -E 'data$' /etc/services  notes: -E is for pattern search,
dollar sign means pattern happens at the end of string.

note: grep is one of the few commands that supports regular expression

grep: regular expression
egrep or grep -E: extended expression

notes: grep stands for global regular expression print

******************************************************
Working with sed
sed should be used with single quotes as well
unless envorinmetal vairalbes are within sed expression, then double quotes should be Suspend

Substitution mode of sed is very powerful
syntax is: sed 's/serach_for_text/repalce_with-text/g'
note: g is for global change

option -i is for inplace change
