File Globbing

? ---> Single Character
! ---> not
[a-z] [0-9] [!0-8]
.[!.]*  --->not to display any files starts with 2 dots at the front
ls -d (notes: d option is not to show any directory contents)

The shell expands the wildcard characters and feed it into commands.

Remember, the wildcard character matches every filename character in any position.

It's very important that there is one exception to this rule: it does not match
filenames starting with a dot, which are called hidden files in Linux.

The question mark does the same, but only in a single position;
it also doesn't match filenames with the leading dot.

The brackets match specific characters in a single position defined between the brackets.
When having consecutive permitted characters, you can also use the dash symbol.
To match everything except a set of characters at a specific position, use the exclamation mark in brackets.

****************************************************
Quoting commands
The purpose is to disable shell expansions
'' Using single quotes is the preferred way when working with shell
" "Double quotes is the same but with exception of some environment variables such as $PATH
\ Back slash is the same as single quotes but only affect and only affect the next single character
