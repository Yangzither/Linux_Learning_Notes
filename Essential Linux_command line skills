The shell is the command line interpreter that translates commands entered by a user into actions to be performed by the operating system. 

*sysadmin@localhost:~$ 
sysadmin is the user name
localhost is the system name
~ indicate this is the home directory

*Linux is case-sensitive. Commands, options, arguments, variables, and file names must be entered exactly as shown.

*The typical format for a command is as follows:
command [options] [arguments]
Options are used to modify the core behavior of a command while arguments are used to provide additional information (such as a filename or a username). 
Each option and argument is normally separated by a space, although options can often be combined.

*ls -lr
  ls -l -r
  ls -rl
  
 *history
 !3 >> No 3 command from history list
 !-3
 !! >> most recent command
 !ls >> the last iteratino of this command
 
 
 * Variables
 Local variable:  When the user closes a terminal window or shell, all of the variables are lost. 
 They are often associated with user-based tasks and are lowercase by convention.
 
 variable='something'
 echo $variable
 
 Environment variables:
 Environment variables, also called global variables, are available system-wide, in all shells used by Bash when interpreting commands and performing tasks. 
 The system automatically recreates environment variables when a new shell is opened. 
 Examples include the PATH, HOME, and HISTSIZE variables. 
 
 Command:
 env >> show environment variables
 
 *How to make a local variable an environment variable:
 export variable1
 
 or create a variable environment upon its creation 
 export variable2="something else"
 
 *How to remove an exported variable
 unset variable2
