The shell is the command line interpreter that translates commands entered by a user into actions to be performed by the operating system. 

*sysadmin@localhost:~$ 
sysadmin is the user name
localhost is the system name
~ indicate this is the home directory

*Linux is case-sensitive. Commands, options, arguments, variables, and file names must be entered exactly as shown.
